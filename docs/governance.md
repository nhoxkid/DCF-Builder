# Governance & Compliance

The repository ships with standard open-source governance artifacts:

- `LICENSE` – MIT license grant for code reuse
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` – Contributor Covenant v2.1
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – branching, coding style, and review expectations
- `SECURITY.md` – vulnerability disclosure process (security@dcf-builder.dev)
- `CHANGELOG.md` – human-readable release notes capturing engine & UI changes

Automated change metadata is also embedded into valuation outputs via `runMetadata` (timestamp, commit SHA, config origin).
